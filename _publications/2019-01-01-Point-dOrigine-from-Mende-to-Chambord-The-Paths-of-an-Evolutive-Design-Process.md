Abstract:
Point d.Origine is a musico-architectural installation that converts, through mathematical objects called “spherical harmonics”, the architecture of remarkable buildings into musical sounds and sequences. To experience it, the visitor takes a small object called a “harmonic lantern”, whose role is to geolocalize his/her position in the space of the building, and wears a noise-cancelling headset. Since the transposition is computed for each point within the building, by his movements and displacements, he generates harmonic sound trajectories of which he is simultaneously the composer, the musician and the audience.
