**Abstract:**
Following three years of working on the eTube with a collaborative interdisciplinary team, we describe the embodied and spatialized performance gestures developed in tandem with a microphone setup for interacting with musical improvising agents. Eric Lewis’ discussion of the intentional stance and make-believe are outlined as a way to conceptualize our working process and engagement with musical agents in improvisation. Within this context, we consider the various agencies at play, and how the musical agents challenge notions of the social and embodiment in improvisation. We will then describe certain artistic approaches and results that are afforded by merging the philosophical with practice. A collaboration with other artists will illustrate new eTube performance gestures. Finally, we outline spatialization models designed for the musical agents and how these were developed in the context of the eTube performance practice.
