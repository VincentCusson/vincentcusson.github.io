Abstract:
We demonstrate the production of custom interactive environments while comparing the type of resources that can be used for building oneself floor sensing arrays to be used as comparable touch responsive systems for interactive environments made either of organic or of synthetic resources. Who is gonna win the Polymers Battle?
