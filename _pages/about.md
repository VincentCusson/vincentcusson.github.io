My projects investigate generative, immersive, and interactive audio in various inter-disciplinary art installations and performances.
I completed a Bachelor's in **Interactive Media** at **UQAM** and have been assistant researcher for five years at **nxi gestatio design lab** [(NXI)](http://www.nxigestatio.org/).

In fall 2019, I began a master's degree in **Music Technology** at **McGill**. I am collaborating on different projects with researchers from **Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology** [(CIRMMT)](https://www.cirmmt.org/) and **Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory** [(IDMIL)](http://www-new.idmil.org/).


## Research Interests:

- Sound installations
- Multi user collaboration
