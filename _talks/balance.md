The T-Stick-based sonic installation 'Balance' was be presented and analyzed. 
A reflection around the affordances and constraints used to engage the public with Digital Musical Instruments (DMI) is one of the focus of this talk.
I also discuss the artistic process that occurred from the two workshops and the presentation of the work.
