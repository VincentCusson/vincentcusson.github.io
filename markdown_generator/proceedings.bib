	abstract = {Point d.Origine is a musico-architectural installation that converts, through mathematical objects called “spherical harmonics”, the architecture of remarkable buildings into musical sounds and sequences. To experience it, the visitor takes a small object called a “harmonic lantern”, whose role is to geolocalize his/her position in the space of the building, and wears a noise-cancelling headset. Since the transposition is computed for each point within the building, by his movements and displacements, he generates harmonic sound trajectories of which he is simultaneously the composer, the musician and the audience. Everything happens like if myriads of sound droplets where suspended in the air, waiting for the lantern to cross them in order to be played. Since the sounds are polyphonic, the music that is heard at a given point depends on the trajectory that was taken to reach this point. If the visitor stays still, the music stops. Our team has put a lot of efforts at all levels (design, functionality, ergonomy... ) to make the installation simple and easy to experiment. People of all ages, from kids to elderlies, have been able to try and enjoy it. For those who are interested in knowing more about the scientific, theoretical and technological roots of the project, the installation is accompanied by an exhibition in which posters, video animation and small sculptures describe the underlying processes, principles and methods. A first version of Point d.Origine was presented in the French Gothic cathedral of Mende, in 2017. The second version was presented in 2019 in the Chateau de Chambord, a fairly known historical monument. The passage from Mende to Chambord gave us a lot of opportunities to explore and improve all parts of the project, and to develop a technological premiere in terms of localization. In this lecture, we present the major evolutions that occurred between the two installations, in particular the complete redesign of the harmonic lanterns and the development of new localization system, itself a premiere, based on a collaborative network involving the lanterns themselves and a set of small beacons fixed on the walls. These developments were required because of the number and complexity of the spaces within Chambord, and because of the nature of the audience, which is completely different from the audience in Mende: as the second largest castle in France after Versailles, Chambord welcomes more than one million visitors a year, generating a completely new set of environmental constraints. Comparing the two systems in Mende and Chambord provides a clear illustration of the evolutive nature of the design process itself, and will allow us to demonstrate the multiple paths of adaptation that it must follow to react to changing external conditions.},

	title = {{ESCHE} {BACH}},
	url = {https://www.generativeart.com/GA2018_papers/GA2018_NICOLAS%20REEVES.pdf},
	abstract = {The name of the project comes from the homonymy between "ECCE BACH" ("Here is Bach" in
Latin), and the first letters of the full name of the bacterium E. coli, escherichia coli.
The project itself consists of coding several musical pieces of J.S. Bach into DNA strands, using a
four-letter coding that corresponds to the four nucleobases that enters in the composition of this
molecule, forming the basic elements of the genetic code, namely adenine, guanine, cytosine and
thymine, identified by their initials A, G, C T.
The DNA strands thus encoded are injected into the genome of E.coli bacteria and of yeast microorganisms. They replace some of the silent sections of the genome. These sections, whose role is
just beginning to be understood, do not normally express themselves during morphogenesis and
therefore have no known impact on the appearance of the micro-organisms (phenotype) or on
their vital functions. Several bacteria and yeasts are prepared, each carrying a given piece. They
are released into a nutritious substrate where they are left to evolve on their own for several
weeks.
During this period, they grow and reproduce a very large number of times; a single generation
lasts 20 to 30 minutes. By means of natural mutations and other phenomena, all sections of the
genome, including the one where the musical piece is coded, are transformed and modified. At
regular intervals, samples of bacteria and yeasts are retrieved. Their DNA is extracted and
decoded at the precise places where the musical pieces were recorded. The modified nucleotide
sequences are then converted back to music, resulting in a set of variations from the original
themes.
These variations will then transcribed on classical music scores, in anticipation of a performance
/ concert where a selected sample of them will be performed by a quartet of classical musicians,
accompanied by a pianist, and, depending on the playability of the vocal sections, by two
choristers. The première of this concert is expected April 2019.},
