Gestural interfaces like the [T-Stick](http://www-new.idmil.org/project/the-t-stick/) offer the opportunity to explore controls beyond the classic musical metaphor. It could refer to a wind instrument or a percussion mallet at first glance but could also spark imagination and evoke a paddle or a fishing rod. Its affordance also is clearly related to the 3D space, with this additional dimension where so much can happen.


The idea is to arrange multiple Sopranino T-Stick in a sculptural way, reminiscent of a sonic installation, for a performer or the public to play with. The emphasis would be put on their position and rotation in space, acting like a controller for an original ambient interactive composition. The physical and positional limitations (guides, cables, etc.) normally unwanted in this kind of device, would help the engagement of non-experts.
Taking advantage of the conductive and pressure sensor embeded in the T-Stick, another layer of more minute gestures were developed to allow a more dynamic sonic exploration.


I took the opportunity to explore the possible integration with the open-source virtual modular synthesizer [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/). This software allows the creation of complex soundscapes and the CV control paradigm is similar to the continuous gestural control information from the T-Stick. The input processing and mapping is done in [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max).
